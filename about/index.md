	My name is Adam Kenneweg, and I study Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
I’m passionate about programming, and I’m currently exploring how this can fulfil my other passions: people, communities, travel, language, and communication.

###I enjoy:###
* attending social events with friends
* reading various things (my favourite genre is fantasy)
* travelling to different parts of the world
* watching movies (my favourite is Fight Club)
* solving puzzles(rubik's cubes, logic puzzles, programming problems)
* cooking and eating food
